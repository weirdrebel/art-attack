# Art Attack ðŸŽ¨

This project provides users with an easy-to-use and fun way to draw images virtually, eliminating the need for traditional brush and color setup. It offers a wide range of tools to edit and enhance created art.

## Features

1. *Virtual Painter*: Users can draw in a virtual environment by waving their hand in the air. The camera captures hand movements, displaying the drawing on the camera screen and a separate canvas. Users can select shapes and colors using a GUI, controlled by finger gestures.

2. *Background Remover*: Allows users to remove the background of any image from their system. The background is replaced with a white sheet, and the modified image can be saved.

3. *Background Changer*: Users can change the background of any selected image from their system with another image. The modified image can be saved.

4. *Artistic Effects*:
   - *Pointillistic Art*: Image divided into points using k-means clustering. Users can adjust radius and number of points for different effects.
   - *Sketching Effect*: Image rendered in grayscale resembling a pencil sketch. Both grayscale and color versions are saved.
   - *Watercolor Effect*: Transform image into a watercolor-like representation using cv2.stylization() function.
   - *Enhance Details*: Enhance sharpness and structure of an image using specific parameters.
